==============

Storage spaces for your project files and history. Think of it as a folder for a project.


Github Introduction::
==================

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: :: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.

Github branching strategy::
===========================

Github Branching Model::
-------------------------------

A GitHub branching model is a structured way of organizing branches in a Git repository to manage development workflows effectively. It helps teams work collaboratively, isolate features, manage releases, and deploy code more efficiently.

<img width="1738" height="779" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d0bb86-0465-462b-b6e2-85b9adb23d68" />


A GitHub branching strategy is crucial for maintaining an organized workflow in version control. There are different strategies depending on the size of the project, the number of team members, and the desired workflow. Here are some common branching strategies used in GitHub:

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.08.05

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.08.10

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.

Branches:
==============


main (or master): Always production-ready.

feature/*: Used for new features.

release/*: Prepares for a new production release.

main or master branch:: 
=====================

This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically. main or master branch always stable and live code

feature branch:: 
===============

It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

release branch:: 
====================

Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle. always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.07.20

hotfix branch:: 
==================

always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

Jenkins server ask git if there is any changes in git server or not, if changes there Jenkins server build/package the changes , every change build happened like 5 mints ,means every 5 minutes verify the Jenkins server to git if there is any changes 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f436ad6-e92a-40e3-831a-23219c288217)

POLL SCM ----* * * * * --every minute when every commit 

Build Periodically:::	
============================

H/15 * * * *   ----this build happened every 5 minutes without commits ,if changes are commit or not but every 5 mints build happened in Jenkins 


Please create a New Jenkins jobs both POLL SCM & Build Periodically 

https://github.com/srinfotechbatch2/spring-petclinic.git

https://github.com/srinfotechbatch2/onlinebookstore.git

Automatically Discard Old Builds:::
==============================
To automate the process of discarding old builds, you can configure the job’s settings to automatically delete old builds based on criteria such as the number of builds to keep or the age of the builds.

Follow these steps:

Open the Jenkins job (project).
Click on Configure (on the left-hand side).
Scroll down to the Build Discarder section (usually under the Build Triggers section).
Check Discard old builds.
Specify the following options:
Max # of builds to keep: Set the maximum number of builds to keep.
Max days to keep builds: Set the maximum age for builds to keep.
Save the configuration by clicking Save.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d8c9cf9-988a-41e4-b052-539ef601171f)


Execute concurrent builds if necessary::
===================================

When this option is checked, multiple builds of this project may be executed in parallel.
By default, only a single build of a project is executed at a time — any other requests to start building that project will remain in the build queue until the first build is complete.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909edd87-548d-4ded-a862-29cf850fac05)


Here 5 builds execute parallel ,I kept executor is 5 this is same machine 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a840a224-5cbb-43cc-92c1-d135db4ce00f)


Build Periodically:::	H/15 * * * *   ----this build happened every 5 minutes without commits ,if changes are commit or not but every 5 mints 

build happened in Jenkins 

Execute the Jobs in Parallel::
==============================


1.By Default execute the Jenkins build jobs are sequence way,one by one 

2.Don’t do 2 projects build parallel  this is real time scenario but we can do parallel builds as well one job

Jenkins build parallel setup

Go job ---> configure ----> Generall ---> Execute concurrent builds if necessary

Pipelines Introduction:::

A Jenkins pipeline is a series of automated steps or stages that define the process of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your code. Jenkins, being a popular open-source automation server, uses pipelines to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines:

1. Declarative Pipeline

2. Scripted Pipeline

1. Declarative Pipeline::
The declarative pipeline syntax is simpler and more structured. It's the recommended style for most users because it's easy to read and maintain

Create Pipeline Project::
=======================

Steps

stages{

Stage ('Clone'){

steps{

// write code
}
}

Stage ('Build'){
steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Test'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}
Stage ('Execute test casea and get the results'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Generated Artifact'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Deploy'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

// write code

}

}

Please try to create one pipeline job in jenkinsfile and execute the below Declarative pipeline example:;

   agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/srinfotech7358/spring-petclinic.git'
            }
        }
        
          stage('Build') {
            steps {
               bat 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
          stage('Test') {
            steps {
               bat 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        
          stage('Generate Junit Test Results') {
            steps {
               junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            }
        }
        
          stage('Generate Artifacts') {
            steps {
               archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', followSymlinks: false
            }
        }
    }
}


Plugins::
===============

Plugins in Jenkins are essential components that extend its core functionality, allowing you to customize Jenkins to meet specific CI/CD needs. Jenkins has a vast plugin ecosystem that supports building, deploying, and automating software projects across various platforms and tools

Install Plugins in Jenkins::
==============================

Step-by-Step:
Log in to Jenkins as an administrator.

Navigate to Manage Jenkins (usually on the left sidebar).

Click on Manage Plugins.

(Image reference from Jenkins documentation)

Go to the Available tab.

Use the search box to find the plugin you want.

Difference between Declarative and Scripted pipelines::
======================================================

The difference between Declarative and Scripted pipelines in Jenkins primarily lies in syntax, structure, and ease of use. Both are used to define CI/CD workflows, but they cater to different user needs and experience levels.


Declarative Pipeline::
=====================


1.Simpler, more structured syntax

2.Enforces a predefined, opinionated structure (pipeline, stages, steps)

3.Designed for readability and ease of use

4.Introduced later to make pipelines easier for users unfamiliar with Groovy


Scripted Pipeline::
=======================


1.More flexible, written in full Groovy

2.Gives access to full programmatic control (e.g., loops, conditionals, custom functions)

3.More complex and powerful, suited for advanced users

Tomcat Web Server: Introduction
==============================

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily used to serve Java applications and is one of the most popular servlet containers in the world.

Tomcat is an essential tool for anyone working with Java web applications. It provides a simple, reliable platform for deploying and managing Java Servlets and JSPs and is widely used in both development and production environments. Its ease of use, combined with powerful features and flexibility, makes it an ideal choice for many developers working on Java-based web applications.

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that is primarily used to serve Java-based web applications. It implements several Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specifications, such as Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket, among others. Tomcat is often used to run Java applications on the web because it's lightweight, easy to configure, and widely supported.

Here are some key points about Tomcat:

1. **Servlet Container**: Tomcat is a servlet container, meaning it manages the lifecycle of Java Servlets, which are small Java programs that run on a web server.
  
2. **JSP Support**: Tomcat also supports JavaServer Pages (JSP), a technology that allows for embedding Java code within HTML pages.

3. **Configuration**: It’s highly configurable through XML files, like `server.xml` for server settings, `web.xml` for application settings, and others.

4. **Lightweight**: Unlike full-fledged application servers like WildFly (formerly JBoss) or GlassFish, Tomcat is primarily a servlet and JSP container, which makes it lighter and easier to deploy for simpler Java web applications.

5. **Performance**: It’s known for good performance in handling static content, making it a popular choice for Java web developers.

Integrate Tomcat Jenkins::
==============================



<img width="1781" height="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e73356b2-6037-4556-a8b1-28459191147b" />



Integrating Tomcat with Jenkins is a common use case for automating the deployment of Java-based web applications. Jenkins can be set up to deploy a web application to a Tomcat server whenever a new build is triggered.

Prerequisites:

Apache Tomcat should be installed and running on your server.
Jenkins should be installed and running.

Steps to integrate Jenkins with Tomcat:

1. Install the "Deploy to Container" Plugin in Jenkins:
The easiest way to deploy to Tomcat from Jenkins is by using the Deploy to Container plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server.

Go to your Jenkins dashboard.
Click on Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
In the Available tab, search for Deploy to Container Plugin and install it.
Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the plugin.

2. Configure Tomcat Server in Jenkins:
Now you need to tell Jenkins where your Tomcat server is running.

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
Scroll down to the Deploy to container section.
Click Add Tomcat Server.

Provide the necessary information:
Name: Give the Tomcat server a name (Tomcat9).
URL: The URL of your Tomcat server (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Username: The username for Tomcat's manager app (usually admin).
Password: The password for that username (set in Tomcat's tomcat-users.xml).
Save the configuration.

3. Configure Tomcat’s tomcat-users.xml:
Make sure Tomcat is set up to allow Jenkins to deploy the application by editing the tomcat-users.xml file.

  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-script"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status, admin-gui, admin-script"/>




Restart Tomcat to apply the changes.

4. Create a Jenkins Job to Build and Deploy the Application:
Next, you need to create a Jenkins job that will build your web application (e.g., a WAR file) and deploy it to Tomcat.

From the Jenkins dashboard, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project, give it a name, and click OK.

>TomcatServer Integrate With Jenkins

In the job configuration, go to the Build section and configure your build step, such as building a Maven project For Maven, you can use:

> mvn clean install

In the Post-build Actions section, add Deploy war/ear to a container.

In the WAR/EAR files field, provide the path to your WAR file (e.g., target/*.war).
In the Container field, choose the Tomcat server you configured earlier.
Set the Context Path (e.g., TomcatIntegartedWithJenkins), which is the URL path where the application will be accessible on Tomcat.
If you want Jenkins to deploy automatically after every successful build, check the option Deploy after every successful build.

please use below project to configured Tomcat integration

Polling SCM (Source Code Management) and webhooks are two common methods used for integrating continuous integration (CI) systems or automating tasks based on changes in repositories.

1. Polling SCM
Polling SCM is a method where a system (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.) periodically checks the source code repository for changes. If it detects changes, it triggers the build process or some other automated task.

How it works:

A job is set up to check the SCM (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or hour).

The CI server pulls the repository to see if there are any new commits since the last poll.

If changes are detected, it triggers the CI/CD pipeline to build, test, or deploy the application.

2. Webhooks
Webhooks provide a more efficient method for triggering actions based on changes in the repository. Rather than the CI system polling for changes, the source control platform sends an HTTP POST request (webhook) to the CI system when an event (like a commit or pull request) occurs.

Integrate Jenkins with Tomcat using Declarative Approach::
=========================================================



To integrate Jenkins with Tomcat using the Declarative Pipeline approach, you'll be using Jenkins Pipeline syntax to automate the deployment process to a Tomcat server. This process typically involves building the application, packaging it, and then deploying it to Tomcat.

1. Jenkinsfile Configuration (Declarative Pipeline)

In your Jenkins project, you'll create a Jenkinsfile, which contains the Declarative Pipeline syntax. This file defines the steps involved in the CI/CD pipeline.

Please execute below script in jenkins pipeline job using Declarative style

Introduction to SonarQube::
================================

SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource that is used for continuous inspection of code quality. It helps developers and development teams identify bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, and duplication in their codebases across multiple programming languages.

Key Features of SonarQube
Static Code Analysis
SonarQube analyzes source code without executing it, detecting issues like:

Bugs

Vulnerabilities

Code smells (bad design or coding practices)

Duplications

Technical debt
