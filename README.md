DevOps::
DevOps is a software development and operations (DevOps) methodology that combines these two to improve efficiency and speed up project deliverables, It's very important because it helps businesses/deliver software faster and with higher quality.

What is the key purpose of DevOps? 

The primary goal of DevOps is to bridge the gap between development and operations teams. It creates a streamlined, efficient workflow that delivers software faster and with higher quality. DevOps is a set of practices,tools that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.

DevOps Engineer Roles::
=========================

1)The devops engineer was responsibility to release the product to the market as soon as possible 

2) release the product speed to the market

3)Devops engineer was give continues feedback to the developers 

4) Devops engineer responsibility start from git and end with production

5) Design, build, and maintain Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

6) Automate the build, test, and deployment processes.


   
Benefits of DevOps ::
=======================

1) Faster software delivery

2)Reduces lead times and speeds up the software delivery process • 

3)Higher software quality

4)Addresses bugs quicker and improves software quality 

5)Better collaboration

6)Unifies development and operations teams, enhancing collaboration and efficiency 

7)Competitive advantage: Creates a more nimble software development lifecycle that gives businesses an advantage over their competitors

Github::
==========

Github is a one of the SCM(Source code management) tool and store the Project code.

Repository: 
===================

storage area of your source code. Create a Repository on GitHub  

OR

Repositories::	
==============

Storage spaces for your project files and history. Think of it as a folder for a project.


Github Introduction::
==================

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: :: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.

Github branching strategy::
===========================

Github Branching Model::
-------------------------------

A GitHub branching model is a structured way of organizing branches in a Git repository to manage development workflows effectively. It helps teams work collaboratively, isolate features, manage releases, and deploy code more efficiently.

<img width="1738" height="779" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d0bb86-0465-462b-b6e2-85b9adb23d68" />


A GitHub branching strategy is crucial for maintaining an organized workflow in version control. There are different strategies depending on the size of the project, the number of team members, and the desired workflow. Here are some common branching strategies used in GitHub:

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.08.05

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.08.10

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.

Branches:
==============


main (or master): Always production-ready.

feature/*: Used for new features.

release/*: Prepares for a new production release.

main or master branch:: 
=====================

This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically. main or master branch always stable and live code

feature branch:: 
===============

It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: 
=============

feature/YYYY.MM.DD feature/2025.06.22

release branch:: 
====================

Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle. always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.07.20

hotfix branch:: 
==================

always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes


Raise PR (Pull Request) :: 
=================================
